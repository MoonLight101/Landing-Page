# Landing-Page
This is the second project of mine - simple landing page html + css 

That was an interesting challenge to figure out how to recreate a static page from just a look of it and little info.

I purposefully leave it without meaningful content inside, as I want to move on and not linger too much with thing that are not entirely relevant.

I can come back later to it to polish it up a bit.
